### Blockchain and Identity

Projects/companies working on blockchain and identity (pull requests welcome):

 * [Namecoin](http://namecoin.org/) is a blockchain that has been conceived from the start to be used for registering domain names. It is the first fork of the Bitcoin software.
 * [NameID](https://nameid.org/) is an OpenID service based on Namecoin identifiers.
 * [CertCoin](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.857/2014/files/19-fromknecht-velicann-yakoubov-certcoin.pdf) is a NameCoin Based Decentralized Authentication System which maintains a public ledger of domains and their associated public keys.
 * [Onename](https://onename.com/) is a company developing [Blockstack](https://github.com/blockstack), a set of tools for registering names using a combination of the Bitcoin blockchain and a distributed hash table (DHT). Blockstack supports well-known domain name operations such as registration, renewal, and transfer.
 * A workshop called [“Rebooting the Web-of-Trust”](http://weboftrust.info/) has produced a paper about a [Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/raw/master/final-documents/dpki.pdf) (DPKI), which registers identifiers and associated public keys on blockchains.
 * The non-profit organization XDI.org has designed a blockchain-based [registry](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i-XChGFsuAi-Id85FWXjX6hOWDn9Sq-qe7ARykJgsBI/) for human-readable names and machine-readable numbers.
 * Startup [Consensys](https://consensys.net/) has developed a blockchain-based identity system called uPort to launch an [“Internet-of-People”](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ethereum-studio-consensys-launches-internet-people-digital-ids-assets-secured-unbuntu-phones-1542620).
 * [Identit.ee](http://www.identit.ee/) is a program to build blockchain identity solutions related to the Estonian e-Residency concept.
 * [BitAlias](https://bitalias.github.io/) allows users to register names in the Bitcoin blockchain and point them to their wallets.
 * [EtherID](http://etherid.org/) allows registration of domain names for an Ethereum account.
 * [ENS](https://github.com/nexusdev/ENS) is the “Ethereal Namespace”, a contract system and set of conventions to form a hierarchical namespace.
 * [Evernym](http://www.evernym.com/) claims to be the first self-sovereign identity platform on a permissioned distributed ledger dedicated solely to identity, and it is fully open source (FOSS). A [podcast](http://bigfintechmedia.com/Podcast/blockchain-and-the-universal-identity) is available that explains the concept of "universal identity".
 * At Ethereum’s DEVCON ONE conference, a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpaTOvAhLR4) on blockchain, digital identity, and public key infrastructure was given.
 * [Bitnation](https://bitnation.co/) seeks to establish the concept of “world citizenship” through identity registration on the blockchain. The project is collaborating with the Estonian e-Residency program and also has a focus on offering ["blockchain emergency IDs"](https://refugees.bitnation.co/) to refugees.
 * Linux foundation [hyper ledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/) project looking to develop a cross-industry open standard with many big companies participating.
 * [ID2020](http://id2020.org/) seeks to provide every child born after 2020 with a self sovereign digital identity, which helps reduce risks of trafficking and drive digital inclusion.
 * [Shocard](https://shocard.com/) is an early stage company developing an “identity platform” built on blockchain.
 * A [research team](http://mm.aueb.gr/) at Athens University of Economics and Business is working on “information-centric” networking and is exploring the use of blockchain technology for “content names”. 
 * The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is [funding](https://blog.aniljohn.com/2015/12/federal-gov-funds-for-identity-r-and-d.html) research on the "Applicability of Blockchain Technology to Privacy Respecting Identity Management"
 * A MIT [paper](http://web.media.mit.edu/~guyzys/data/ZNP15.pdf) about "Decentralizing Privacy: Using Blockchain to Protect Personal Data".
 * An Ethereum [blog post](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/01/15/privacy-on-the-blockchain/) about "Privacy on the Blockchain", including some thoughts about identity systems.
 * [Jolocom](http://jolocom.com/) is developing applications for everyone to own their personal digital identity, using linked data and blockchain technologies.
 * [Danube Tech](http://danubetech.com/) is collaborating with several other efforts to build blockchain-based identifier registration infrastructure.
 * [Scuttlebot](https://scuttlebot.io/) is a "blockchain identity" protocol avoiding a [singleton-based approach](https://scuttlebot.io/more/articles/design-challenge-avoid-centralization-and-singletons.html). It embraces subjectivity over consensus, e.g. each identity can publish messages that map their favorite pet name mappings for themselves and others. [Patchwork](https://ssbc.github.io/patchwork/) is a user-facing decentralized messaging and sharing app based on Scuttlebot.
 * Startup Cambridge Blockchain is working on an [Identity Blockchain](http://cambridge-blockchain.com/alpha_genesis_block.html) for validating secure digital identity documents, processing electronic signatures, and recording transactions.
 * [Proof-of-Individuality](http://proofofindividuality.online/) addresses the challenge to prove that a person only has one account within a system, without sacrificing the advantages of anonymity/pseudonymity. See [here](https://medium.com/@unlisted/anti-sybil-protocol-using-virtual-pseudonym-parties-10276fcf3b20) for a draft implementation using "virtual pseudonym parties".
 * [Regis](http://regis.nu/) is a platform that makes it easy to build, deploy, and manage decentralized registries on the Ethereum blockchain.
