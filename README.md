### Blockchain and Identity

Projects/companies working on blockchain and identity (pull requests welcome):

 * [Namecoin](http://namecoin.org/) is a blockchain that has been conceived from the start to be used for registering names. It has recently received some criticism for reliability.
 * [NameID](https://nameid.org/) is an OpenID service based on Namecoin identifiers.
 * [Onename](https://onename.com/) is a company developing [Blockstack](https://github.com/blockstack), a set of tools for registering names using a combination of the Bitcoin blockchain and a distributed hash table (DHT). Blockstack supports well-known domain name operations such as registration, renewal, and transfer.
 * A workshop called [“Rebooting the Web-of-Trust”](http://weboftrust.info/) has produced a paper about a [Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/raw/master/final-documents/dpki.pdf) (DPKI), which registers identifiers and associated public keys on blockchains.
 * The non-profit organization XDI.org has designed a blockchain-based [registry](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i-XChGFsuAi-Id85FWXjX6hOWDn9Sq-qe7ARykJgsBI/) for human-readable names and machine-readable numbers.
 * Startup [Consensys](https://consensys.net/) has developed a blockchain-based identity system called uPort to launch an [“Internet-of-People”](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ethereum-studio-consensys-launches-internet-people-digital-ids-assets-secured-unbuntu-phones-1542620).
 * [Identit.ee](http://www.identit.ee/) is a program to build blockchain identity solutions related to the Estonian e-Residency concept.
 * [BitAlias](https://bitalias.github.io/) allows users to register names in the Bitcoin blockchain and point them to their wallets.
 * [EtherID](http://etherid.org/) allows registration of domain names for an Ethereum account.
 * [ENS](https://github.com/nexusdev/ENS) is the “Ethereal Namespace”, a contract system and set of conventions to form a hierarchical namespace.
 * [Evernym](http://www.evernym.com/) claims to be the first self-sovereign identity platform on a permissioned distributed ledger dedicated solely to identity, and it is fully open source (FOSS).
 * At Ethereum’s DEVCON ONE conference, a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpaTOvAhLR4) on blockchain, digital identity, and public key infrastructure was given.
 * [Bitnation](https://bitnation.co/) seeks to establish the concept of “world citizenship” through identity registration on the blockchain. The project is collaborating with the Estonian e-Residency program and also has a focus on offering identity services to refugees.
 * Linux foundation [hyper ledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/) project looking to develop a cross-industry open standard with many big companies participating.
 * [Shocard](https://shocard.com/) is an early stage company developing an “identity platform” built on blockchain.
 * The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is [funding](https://blog.aniljohn.com/2015/12/federal-gov-funds-for-identity-r-and-d.html) research on the "Applicability of Blockchain Technology to Privacy Respecting Identity Management"
 * [Jolocom](http://jolocom.com/) is developing applications for everyone to own their personal digital identity, using linked data and blockchain technologies.
 * [Danube Tech](http://danubetech.com/) is collaborating with several other efforts to build blockchain-based identifier registration infrastructure.
 * [Scuttlebot](https://scuttlebot.io/) is a "blockchain identity" protocol avoiding a [singleton-based approach](https://scuttlebot.io/more/articles/design-challenge-avoid-centralization-and-singletons.html). It embraces subjectivity over consensus, e.g. each identity can publish messages that map their favorite pet name mappings for themselves and others. [Patchwork](https://ssbc.github.io/patchwork/) is a user-facing decentralized messaging and sharing app based on Scuttlebot.
